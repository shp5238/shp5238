## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Physics at the University of San Diego, with a minor in math that complements my love for numbers and problem solving. I enjoy exploring how complex concepts from these fields come together to create meaningful software that makes a difference.

My journey as a software developer has taken me through a variety of projects, from building mobile apps to designing user-friendly websites. I find joy in blending creativity with technical skills, whether I am working with React Native, writing Linux shell scripts, or making sure a website looks great on any device. When I am not coding, I like to spend time outdoors hiking, where nature teaches me patience and perseverance. Reading young adult fantasy novels also plays a big part in my life because the stories of adventurous heroes spark my imagination and inspire fresh ideas in my work.

I have a growing interest in cutting-edge fields such as quantum computing and financial modeling, which keep me curious and eager to learn more. For me, programming is not just about solving problems; it is about creating solutions that feel elegant and enjoyable to use.

If you enjoy talking about technology, outdoor adventures, or great books, I would love to connect and share ideas.
